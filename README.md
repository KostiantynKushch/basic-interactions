# This is README for basic-interactions

Simple interactions library are willing to unify and simplify the approach of developing routine interaction tasks as toggle classes for HTML DOM elements.
The main approach is to use one global Class that can obtain and process all actions based on the custom data attributes provided for each element.
The main goal is not develop each time on the new project the common JS code and use instead only HTML markup to add basic interactivity.

## Installation
Install `basic-interactions` package:

```bash
npm install basic-interactions
